  displayed some previous project tasks simulation by using MATLAB/Simulink
    1) a control loop for a test bench sample inspection, which used simulink to simulate the hardware level of the test bench, and used stateflow to program the detection process for process-oriented programming.
    2) a controller design for a 3 DoF Manipulater, which realized a safety trajectory tracking based on barrier Lyapnuov function. Besides a theory called "Time delay estimation" was applied, so that the dynamic system could be calculated without knowing model information.
